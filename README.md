# Flutter BLoC Examples 🧩

A curated collection of idiomatic Flutter BLoC (Business Logic Component) examples—new content added daily to demonstrate unique use‑cases.

## 🚀 About

This repo showcases practical Flutter patterns using the `flutter_bloc` package:
- Everyday UI examples: forms, lists, counters
- API integration & data flow
- Advanced state changes & multi‑bloc coordination
- Unique, creative demos added daily

Inspired by the structure and clarity of my Riverpod repo, this will be the go‑to place for learning Bloc best‑practices.
